TypeScript Installation

Globally Installing TypeScript

(CLI or git bash)

npm install -g typescript

get version in CLI -> tsc -v

We create an intro.ts file

In terminal , write tsc intro.ts

Then a js file with same name and code is created

This is what typescript does , it converts your typescript code into javascript.

When we write code and do tsc intro.ts 

The code will be same as intro.ts in the js file , the only change is we will be able to see errors in the TS filw that we don't usually get while writing javascript code.
